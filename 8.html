        <ul>
        <li><u>Non-renewable energy source</u></li>
        :can be replaced, but only over very long, slowly by natural processes.
        <br>Ex) Nuclear fuels source: uranium-235, nuclear energy
        <br>Fossil fuels source: crude oil, coal, natural gas, chemical potential Energy
        <br><br>

        <li><u>Renewable energy source</u></li>
        :can be replenished in relatively short times.
        <br>Ex) Sun -> solar energy
              <br>Water -> kinetic energy to Potential energy
              <br>Wind -> kinetic energy
              <br>Biomass -> chemical potential energy
              <br>Geothermal -> internal energy

        <u>Internal energy is converted to internal energy and then to electrical energy</u>.<br>
        -> the energy is used to heat water producing steam at high temperatures and high pressures.

        <strong>Nuclear power station</strong><br>
        - nuclear fission: the energy released is equivalent to the difference between the energy needed to deconstruct a large nucleus and that emitted when two smaller nuclei are constructed from its components.<br>
        -> it becomes two smaller nuclei that have greater binding energy than a large nucleus.<br>
      <img src="binding energy.png" width="400">

      <p>
        <strong>Pressurized water reactor(PWR)</strong><br>
        : the energy released in the nuclear fission is used to create high-pressure steam to turn turbines connected to an electrical generator.
        <img src="PWR.jpg" width="600">
        <ul>
          <li>Uranium is mined as an ore made up of 99% Uranium-238 which is not required in fission process<br>
            -> An initial extraction process is required to boost the ratio of Uranium-235 to 3%(Enrichment).</li>
          Enrichement = Uranium-235를 광석에 많게 하는 과정<br>
          Uranium 238 is good absorber so prevents fission reaction becoming self-sustaining of neutrons -> lower reaction rate
          <li>The enrichd material is formed into fuel rods - cylinder of uranium inserted into the core of reactor</li>
          -> most energy released = kinetic energy of the fission fragments and neutrons emitted during the fission
          Enriched 된 걸로 fuel rods를 만들고 fission에서 나온 neutron과 파편의 kinetic energy가 대부분의 에너지다.
          <li>Emitted neutrons are moving at very high speeds but must be lower than 2kms<sup>-1</sup> to sustain fission reaction -> at room temperature, neutrons with lower than 2kms<sup>-1</sup> = thermal neutrons</li>
          방출된 neutron의 속도가 너무 빨라서 fission을 할 수 있는 속도 2kms<sup>-1</sup> 보다 작아야한다.
          <li>Moderator slows down the speeds of neutrons -> not being a god absorber of neutron(-> deutrium oxide=Heavy water)</li>
          neutron을 잘 흡수하지 않는 heavy water나 graphite으로 만들어진 moderator가 emitted neutron과 부딪히면서 속도를 줄여준다.
          - water and graphite moderator -> fast-moving neutrons strike the moderator, lose kinetic energy and move at thermal speeds to increase probability of fission reaction.
          <li>Control rods which are made up of boron absorbing neutrons very well, that can lower fission reaction rate -> keeping energy output of the reactor through raising and lowering control rods</li>
          - 일정한 power output을 위해 neutrons을 잘 흡수하는 boron 같은 물질로 만들어진 control rods를 줄였다 늘렸다 한다.
          <li>Heat exchanger conveys the internal energy from inside the reactor to the turbines.</li>
          -> collecting energy from moderator and other hot region of reactor and delivers to the water.<br>
          -> turbine steam cannot be directly piped through the reactor vessel because there is a chance of readioactive material transferring outsdie reactor vessel -> should be closed system.<br>
          Heat exchanger는 primary source의 internal energy ->thermal energy in moderator, hot region에서 water로 옮겨서 turbine을 돌리고 electrical energy를 만든다.<br>
          Turbine과 reactor vessel은 바로 연결하지 않음, 왜? radioactive material(uranium)이 밖으로 나갈수 있기 때문.
        </ul>
        <strong>에너지의 변화 과정이 중요</strong><br>
        Nuclear energy, Internal energy of Uranium -> Kinetic energy of neutrons -> Thermal energy of moderator, hot region of reaction vessel -> Internal energy of steam -> Kinetic energy of turbine -> Electric energy in generator

        <strong>Safety issues in nuclear power</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>reactor vessel is made up of thick steel to withstand high temperature and pressure.</li>
          -> absorbing α, β radiations with γ rays and stray neutrons
          <li>containment structure -> layers of very thick concrete to absorb neutrons and γ rays</li>
          <li>emergency safety mechanism to quickly shut the reactor down</li>
          <li>using robots when inserting and removing fuel rods due to highly radioactive exposure</li>
          reactor의 수명은 25~50년 정도, 폐기 할때 fuel rods, concrete shield 다 제거하고 일반적인 토지와 radioactivity가 비슷해질 때까지 홀로 둔다.

        <strong>Wind generators</strong><br>
        - Horizontal/Vertical-axis types<br>
        <img src="Windgenerator.png" width="300"><br>
        To estimate the maximum power available from horziontal-axis,<br>
        Volume of air per second = vA (v: speed of wind, A: blade area)<br>
        Mass of air moving through turbine per second = ρvA (ρ: density of air)<br>
        Kinetic energy of air arriving at turbine per second<br>
        = 1/2 x mass x (speed)<sup>2</sup><br>
        = 1/2 x (ρvA) x v<sup>2</sup><br>
        = 1/2 x ρv<sup>3</sup>A<br>
        = 1/2 x ρπr<sup>2</sup>v<sup>3</sup>
        (A = πr<sup>2</sup>)<br><br>

        <u>Assumptions</u><br>
        <ul>
          <li>all kinetic energy of the wind can be used.<br>
          - wind has to move out of back of turbine. If turbines nearby disturb the flow of air, it leads to a reduction in energy.<br>
          -The air molecules cannot be brought completely to rest in collisions with the blades.(공기 분자가 blade와 부딪히고 속도가 0이 되지 않아서 KE가 다 transfer 되지 않음)
          <li>it suggests that the system has a high wind speed and long blade</li>
          -> but it increases the mass of blade ,then blade cannot rotate at high speeds.
          <li>many wind farms are placed off=shore wind speed higher than land</li>

      <h3>8.2 Thermal energy transfer</h3>
      <strong>Method of heat transfer</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Conduction</li>
        : energy is transferred by direct contact<br>
        - metal is good thermal conductors due to delocalized electrons(collisions)
        <img src="Conduction.png" width="500"><br>
        -until thermal equilibrium(same temperature between 2 objects), the energy supplied through electrons.<br>
        -Conduction is important in solid, can occur in gas and liquid(atoms are farther apart in fluids)<br><br>
        <li>Convection</li>
        : the movement of groups of atoms or molecules within fluids, arises through variations in density.<br>
        - convection cannot take place in solids<br>
        - convection current: cold air goes down and hot air goes up.<br><br>
        <li>Thermal radiation</li>
        : the transfer of energy by means of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
        - thermal radiation doesn't need a medium to move.<br>
        - Sun emits EM radiation to us.<br>
        - Emission: absorb then radiate, Reflection: not absorb<br>
      </ol>
      <br><br>
      <strong>Black-body radiation</strong><br>
      <u>Black body</u><br>
      - it aborbs all wavelengths of EM radiations regardless of angle of incidence.<br>
      - it is a good emitter(radiator) and absorber but poor reflector.<br>
      - The color of black body is black at -273.15K<br>
      - Its surface is important but not dependent on materials of container.<br>
      - Sun is near-perfect blackbody radiator, 6000K<br><br>
      To measure intensity of radiation at a particular wavelengths<br>
      I = Power/Area on power incident<br><br>
      <img src="blackbody.png" width="500"><br>

      As temperature increases,<br>
      - overall intensity at each wavelength increases.<br>
      - total power emitted/m<sup>2</sup> increases -> total area under the graph increases.<br>
      - curves skew towards shorter wavelengths(higher frequency)<br>
      - peak of the curve moves to shorter wavelengths<br>
